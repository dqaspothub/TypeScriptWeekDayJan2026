Class
Object
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction

A class is like a blueprint or design.

A design template to build an Object example mould to make water bottle it has properties example car making stuff

It has Properties and Methods 

📌 Example:

House plan = Class
Actual house = Object

Class does not occupy memory by itself.

class Student{

//Properties

//Methods

}

//To call this class we can access via object

let variableName (refernceVariable) = new ClassName()

Object – Real Instance of a Class

An object is the real thing created from the blueprint.

📌 Example:

Class = Student

Object = Ravi, Anita, John
Object occupies memory.


Encapsulation – Data Hiding
Layman Understanding

Encapsulation:

Wrap data + methods together and protect sensitive data

📌 Real life:

ATM Card

You cannot access balance directly
You must use PIN & methods


Inheritance – Parent → Child Relationship

Inheritance means:

Child class uses properties of parent class

📌 Real life:

Parent → Vehicle
Child → Car, Bike
Child reuses parent code.

Polymorphism – One Thing, Many Forms

Same method name, different behavior

📌 Real life:

Same word “talk”
Human talks
Dog barks
Baby cries

Abstraction – Show What, Hide How

Abstraction means:

Show only necessary details, hide internal logic

📌 Real life:

You use TV remote
You don’t know how signals work internally
