What is Abstraction in TypeScript?

Abstraction is an OOP concept where we show only essential features of an object and hide the internal implementation details.

👉 In simple words:

You know what something does, but not how it does it internally.

🔶 Real-Life Example

Think about an ATM Machine 🏧

You insert card
Enter PIN
Withdraw money

You don’t know:

How it connects to bank servers
How it verifies balance
How transaction is processed internally
That hidden internal logic = Abstraction

How Abstraction is Achieved in TypeScript?

In TypeScript, abstraction is achieved using:

Abstract Class
Interface


Abstraction Using Abstract Class

An abstract class: Cannot create object directly

Can contain:
Abstract methods (without body)
Normal methods (with body)
Properties
Constructors

Syntax:

abstract class ClassName {
    abstract methodName(): void;   // no body

    normalMethod(): void {
        console.log("This is normal method");
    }
}

Rules of Abstract Class

| #  | Rule                                            | Explanation                              | Example                                   |
| -- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1  | Cannot create object                            | You cannot instantiate an abstract class | `new Payment()` ❌                         |
| 2  | Must use `abstract` keyword                     | Class must be declared with `abstract`   | `abstract class Payment {}`               |
| 3  | Can contain abstract methods                    | Methods without body                     | `abstract pay(): void;`                   |
| 4  | Abstract method must not have body              | No `{}` allowed                          | ❌ `abstract pay() {}`                     |
| 5  | Child class must implement all abstract methods | Otherwise error                          | `class Card extends Payment { pay() {} }` |
| 6  | Can contain normal methods                      | Methods with body allowed                | `print() {}`                              |
| 7  | Can have constructor                            | Yes, allowed                             | `constructor(amount:number){}`            |
| 8  | Can have variables                              | Properties allowed                       | `amount:number;`                          |
| 9  | Can use access modifiers                        | public, private, protected allowed       | `protected amount:number;`                |
| 10 | Can extend only one class                       | No multiple inheritance                  | `class A extends B`                       |

abstract class Payment {

    protected amount: number;  // Rule 9

    constructor(amount: number) {   // Rule 7
        this.amount = amount;
    }

    abstract makePayment(): void;   // Rule 3 & 4

    printReceipt(): void {          // Rule 6
        console.log(`Paid ${this.amount}`);
    }
}

class CardPayment extends Payment {

    makePayment(): void {           // Rule 5
        console.log("Payment via Card");
    }
}

let p = new CardPayment(1000);
// let p2 = new Payment(1000); ❌ Rule 1


Rules of Interface (100% Abstraction)

| # | Rule                              | Explanation         | Example |
| - | --------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------- |
| 1 | Cannot create object              | `new Vehicle()` ❌   |         |
| 2 | Cannot have constructor           | Not allowed         |         |
| 3 | Only method signature             | No method body      |         |
| 4 | All methods are public by default | No access modifiers |         |
| 5 | Supports multiple inheritance     | `extends A, B`      |         |
| 6 | Class must implement all methods  | Otherwise error     |         |
| 7 | Can extend another interface      | Yes                 |         |
| 8 | Used to define structure          | Blueprint only      |         |


interface Vehicle {
    start(): void;
    stop(): void;
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    start(): void {
        console.log("Car started");
    }

    stop(): void {
        console.log("Car stopped");
    }
}
