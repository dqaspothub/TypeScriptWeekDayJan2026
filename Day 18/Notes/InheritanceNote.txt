Sure 👍 Let’s understand **Inheritance in TypeScript** in a very simple (layman) way and then move step-by-step into technical explanation with examples.

---

# 🔷 1. What is Inheritance? (Layman Explanation)

Imagine 👇

👉 A **Parent** has some common properties:

* Eye color
* Height
* Family name

👉 A **Child** automatically gets these properties from the parent.

In programming:

* **Parent class** → Base class / Super class
* **Child class** → Derived class / Sub class

💡 Inheritance means:

> One class can reuse properties and methods of another class.

This helps us:

* Avoid repeating code
* Reuse logic
* Maintain clean structure

---

# 🔷 2. Why Do We Need Inheritance?

Without inheritance ❌
We repeat the same code again and again.

With inheritance ✅
We write common code once and reuse it everywhere.

---

# 🔷 3. Basic Syntax of Inheritance in TypeScript

In TypeScript, we use the keyword:

```
extends
```

### Syntax:

```typescript
class Parent {
   // properties and methods
}

class Child extends Parent {
   // additional properties and methods
}
```

---

# 🔷 4. Simple Real-Life Example (Easy Understanding)

Let’s take an example of **Vehicle** 🚗

All vehicles have:

* brand
* start()

So we create a Parent class.

Then:

* Car
* Bike

They inherit from Vehicle.

---

# 🔷 5. Basic Example Program

```typescript
// Parent Class
class Vehicle {
    brand: string;

    constructor(brand: string) {
        this.brand = brand;
    }

    start(): void {
        console.log(this.brand + " vehicle is starting...");
    }
}

// Child Class
class Car extends Vehicle {
    doors: number;

    constructor(brand: string, doors: number) {
        super(brand); // Calling parent constructor
        this.doors = doors;
    }

    showDetails(): void {
        console.log("Brand: " + this.brand);
        console.log("Doors: " + this.doors);
    }
}

// Creating Object
let myCar = new Car("Toyota", 4);

myCar.start();        // Inherited method
myCar.showDetails();  // Child method
```

---

# 🔷 6. Important Concept: super()

When a child class has a constructor,
it **must call parent constructor** using:

```typescript
super()
```

👉 Why?

Because the parent class needs to initialize its properties first.

Example:

```typescript
super(brand);
```

This sends value to parent constructor.

---

# 🔷 7. How It Works Internally

Step-by-step:

1. `Car` extends `Vehicle`
2. Car automatically gets:

   * brand property
   * start() method
3. Car adds its own:

   * doors property
   * showDetails() method
4. When we create `new Car()`

   * Parent constructor runs first (via super)
   * Then child constructor runs

---

# 🔷 8. Method Overriding in Inheritance

Child class can change parent method behavior.

Example:

```typescript
class Animal {
    makeSound(): void {
        console.log("Animal makes sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    makeSound(): void {
        console.log("Dog barks");
    }
}

let d = new Dog();
d.makeSound();  // Dog barks
```

This is called:
👉 **Method Overriding**

---

# 🔷 9. Types of Inheritance in TypeScript

TypeScript supports:

### 1️⃣ Single Inheritance

One child from one parent

```
Animal → Dog
```

### 2️⃣ Multilevel Inheritance

```
Animal → Mammal → Dog
```

Example:

```typescript
class Animal {
    eat() {
        console.log("Eating...");
    }
}

class Mammal extends Animal {
    walk() {
        console.log("Walking...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Mammal {
    bark() {
        console.log("Barking...");
    }
}

let dog = new Dog();
dog.eat();
dog.walk();
dog.bark();
```

# 🔷 10. Access Modifiers and Inheritance

Access modifiers control visibility:

| Modifier  | Accessible in Child? | Accessible Outside? |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| public    | ✅ Yes                | ✅ Yes               |
| protected | ✅ Yes                | ❌ No                |
| private   | ❌ No                 | ❌ No                |

Example:

```typescript
class Person {
    protected name: string;

    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class Student extends Person {
    display() {
        console.log(this.name); // Accessible because protected
    }
}
```

---

# 🔷 11. Real-Time IT Example (Employee System)

```typescript
class Employee {
    name: string;
    salary: number;

    constructor(name: string, salary: number) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    getDetails(): void {
        console.log("Name: " + this.name);
        console.log("Salary: " + this.salary);
    }
}

class Manager extends Employee {
    department: string;

    constructor(name: string, salary: number, department: string) {
        super(name, salary);
        this.department = department;
    }

    getDetails(): void {
        super.getDetails();
        console.log("Department: " + this.department);
    }
}

let mgr = new Manager("Ravi", 80000, "IT");
mgr.getDetails();
```

# 🔷 12. Key Points to Remember

✅ Use `extends` for inheritance
✅ Use `super()` to call parent constructor
✅ Child can access:

* public
* protected
  ❌ Child cannot access private members
  ✅ Method overriding is allowed
  ❌ Multiple inheritance (like Java) is NOT supported in TypeScript classes
