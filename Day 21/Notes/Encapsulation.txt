What is Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is the OOP principle of:

Bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) together inside a class and restricting direct access to some of the object’s components.

In simple words:

Hide internal details

Expose only what is necessary

Protect data from accidental modification

🎯 2. Why Do We Need Encapsulation?

Without encapsulation:

Anyone can modify variables directly

No control over validation

Hard to maintain code

Data integrity can break

With encapsulation:

Data is protected

Validation can be enforced

Code becomes secure and maintainable


| Rule | Explanation                            |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Use `private` for sensitive data       |
| 2    | Provide public methods to access data  |
| 3    | Validate inside setter methods         |
| 4    | Do not expose internal implementation  |
| 5    | Keep data and related methods together |
