What is Hoisting?

Hoisting is JavaScript behavior where variable declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

📌 Only declarations are hoisted, not assignments

Hoisting with var
console.log(a); // ✅ undefined
var a = 10;

JavaScript treats it like:

var a;
console.log(a);
a = 10;

✔ var is hoisted
✔ Initialized as undefined

--------------------------------------------------
Hoisting with let
console.log(b); // ❌ Error
let b = 20;

➡️ let is hoisted but not initialized

📌 This phase is called Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) - (Time between variable creation and initialization where accessing it causes an error.)

-------------------------------------------------

Hoisting with const
console.log(c); // ❌ Error
const c = 30;

➡️ Same as let
➡️ Must be initialized at declaration
