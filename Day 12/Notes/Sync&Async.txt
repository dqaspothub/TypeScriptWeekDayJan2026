Synchronous vs Asynchronous

What is Synchronous?

Code runs line by line
Each task waits for the previous one to finish
This is also called blocking behavior

👉 If one task takes time, everything else stops

Imagine standing in a queue at a bank 🏦

Person 1 finishes → Person 2 starts

No one can move ahead until the current person is done

What is Asynchronous?

Long tasks run in background
JavaScript does not wait
Non-blocking behavior

Uses:

setTimeout
Promises
async / await
API calls

Think of ordering food at a restaurant 🍽️

You place order
While food is prepared, you chat or use phone
Food arrives later

| Feature         | Synchronous             | Asynchronous                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Execution       | Line by line            | Background execution             |
| Blocking        | Yes                     | No                               |
| Waiting         | Mandatory               | Not required                     |
| Performance     | Slow                    | Faster                           |
| User Experience | Poor (UI freeze)        | Smooth                           |
| Examples        | Loops, normal functions | setTimeout, Promise, async/await |


A callback function is:

A function that is passed as an argument to another function and executed later, usually after some task is completed.

📌 In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, so they can be:

Assigned to variables
Passed as arguments
Returned from other functions


You order food 🍔

Chef cooks food
After food is ready, waiter calls you

👉 “Call me after food is ready” = callback



What is Callback Hell?

Callback Hell happens when:

Multiple asynchronous operations depend on each other

Each callback is nested inside another callback

Code becomes deeply indented, hard to read and maintain

📌 It’s also called:

Pyramid of Doom

Nested callbacks

Scenario: Online Exam Result Process 🎓

Login student

Fetch exam details

Calculate result

Send email notification

Each step must wait for the previous one.

// Callback Hell = Situation in JavaScript where callbacks 
//                            are nested within other callbacks to the
//                           degree where the code is difficult to read.
//                           Old pattern to handle asynchronous functions.

What is a Promise?

A Promise is an object that represents a value that will be available in the future
– either successfully or with an error.

Scenario: Online Food Order 🍕

You place an order

Restaurant says: “Order accepted”

Later:

Food delivered ✅ → fulfilled

Order cancelled ❌ → rejected

📌 That order slip is a Promise

| State     | Meaning | Real Life         |
| --------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| Pending   | Waiting | Food being cooked |
| Fulfilled | Success | Food delivered    |
| Rejected  | Failed  | Order cancelled   |


What is async / await?

async / await is syntactic sugar built on top of Promises.
It makes asynchronous code look synchronous, without blocking JavaScript.

Why async / await was needed?

Before async/await:

Callbacks → callback hell

Promises → .then().then().catch() chains (still messy)

👉 async / await gives:

Cleaner code

Better readability

Easier error handling
